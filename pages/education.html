										<h2>Overview</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I am a second year Computer Science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology expecting to graduate in Fall 2019. My expected threads (concentrations) are in <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/information-internetworks" target="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/information-internetworks">Information Internetworks</a> and <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/intelligence" target="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>. Scroll down to learn more about how I'm involved at Georgia Tech, what classes I have taken, and the classes that I'm taking this Fall Semester (2017)!</p>

									</header>
									<p>At Georgia Tech, I regularly attend GIT MAD (Android Development Club) and The Agency (Artifical Intelligence Club). GIT MAD is a great resource that is helping me learn how to develop programs in Android Studio. Paired with my existing skills in Xcode and Swift, this helps to broaden my perspective on app development. At The Agency, we talk about various AI topics such as smarter searching algorithms and neural networks. As a student who has a thread (concentration) in Artifical Intelligence, attending The Agency is a great first insight into the world of AI.</p>
									<p>You can learn more about what these clubs are all about using the links below!</p>

									</ul>
									<p>Another way I involve myself is with hackathons. Last September, I participated in HackGT for the first time to increase my exposure to the world of computing and I loved it. This October I seek to participate again to complete a project and learn more new skills.</p>
									<p>Every semester, I also play on an intramural basketball team. We generally have a practice and a game every week for around a month.</p>

												<h2>Classes Taken</h2>
											</header>
											<dl>
												<dt>CS 1331: Intro to Object Oriented Programming</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>In this class, I learned fundamental Java programming skills that are an essential base for higher level classes. We also covered basic object oriented programming principles such as inheritance and polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. The project I worked on from CS 1331 can be found <a href="https://github.com/kliao2016/civilization_fall16" target="https://github.com/kliao2016/civilization_fall16">here</a>.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>CS 1332: Data Structures and Algorithms</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>In CS 1332, we utilized Java to cover essential data structures and algorithms in computer science. After taking this class, I am familiar with common data structures like stacks, queues, maps, and binary search trees. I am also familiar with graph and string searching algorithms. Like CS 1331, this class helped me establish a solid foundation of skills for the future.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>CS 2051: Honors Discrete Mathematics</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>CS 2051 has helped me think more creatively about mathematics and computer science through learning about topics such as graph theory, cryptography, counting, and boolean logic. Through CS 2051, I have a better understanding of how computers process and perform calculations, it has definitely helped me improve as a coder.</p>

												<h2>Current Classes (Fall 2017)</h2>
											</header>
											<dl>
												<dt>CS 2110: Intro to Computer Organization and Programming</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>CS 2110 is all about the most fundamental workings of a computer. We will be learning about logic gates, ALUs, how a memory is made, and C programming throughout this Fall semester. This is a fun class and I'm excited to learn exactly how a computer works.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>CS 2340: Objects and Design</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>As a CS student, I am highly interested in entering the field of software development in the future. CS 2340 provides a perfect environment for me to experience what being a software developer is like. Throughout the course of this semester, we will be learning about various developement models such as the Agile Developement model, and we will be polishing our knowledge in object oriented programming. I am currently part of a team of 5 and we will be creating an app in Android Studio this Fall.</p>
												</dd>
												<dt>ISYE 3770: Statistics and Applications</dt>
												<dd>
													<p>I'm excited to learn about probability and statistics because I believe that it will help me develop important analysis skills that will stay with me in anything that I do as I progress through my career. We will be learning about discrete and continuous probability as well as various analytical methods for statistics.</p>
