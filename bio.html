          <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Kevin Liao. I grew up in a suburb of Denver known as Littleton, Colorado and I am currently a first-year Computer Science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p><p>I didn't make my decision to pursue a career in Computer Science until my senior year in high school, when I took AP Computer Science. Before my senior year, I had always thought that I was going to be an engineer. Learning about basic Java and Object Oriented design inspired me to immerse myself in computer science. I realized that I am truly passionate about software and computers and how they interact with the world.</p><p>Since my introduction to the world of CS, I have sought to learn new skills on my own time to expand my knowledge and feed my curiosity. For example, I have taken advantage of resources such as Lynda to learn basic HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and iOS Development through Xcode.</p><p>As a new recruit to the field of computer science, I have only worked on a small number of projects (you can check them out <a href="sampleworks.html">here</a>!) and my skill set is still expanding. However, I seek to take advantage of the many resources at Georgia Tech and use my time here to continue to build projects and integrate myself with the world of CS. <!--<p>I want to learn about how algorithms in coding can have an impact in software design, information, and interactive technology. While I have basic experience in coding, I want to be able to apply my knowledge practically.</p><p>Along with computers, I also enjoy being outdoors. I am an avid golfer, skier, and hiker. On days when the weather is not ideal, I love to watch sports and play some table tennis.</p><p>As a first-year college student, my skill set is still expanding; however, I already have some experience with Java, HTML, CSS, Xcode, and Bootstrap. You can check out some of my work in my Sample Works tab.</p><p>In order to expand my skills, I have involved myself with various activities at Georgia Tech. This September, I participated in HackGT (A 48 hour marathon where I worked with three other people to build a project) to gain experience in app building, and I hope to join the iOS and Video Game Development Clubs when my schedule has room for them.</p><p>As of now, I am unsure of where I want to go with my career because there are so many options, but my goal for the next four years is to create my own app, work in internships, and find a job where I can pursue my interests after I graduate from Georgia Tech.</p>-->

    <div class="container" id="myinfo">
      <p>Professionally, I am interested in big data, computer networks, information management, operating systems, and embedded computational artifacts. I also enjoy web development and app development. At Georgia Tech, I am considering pursuing a Computer Science degree with threads in Systems and Architecture and Info Internetworks. However, these threads may change as I continue to take classes and refine my interests. Computer science is such a comprehensive field that as a beginner, I want to be open to anything to learn as much as possible and realize what I am most passionate in.</p>

      <p>Outside the realm of computer science, I am an avid golfer, skier, and hiker. I also enjoy camping, rock climbing, table tennis, frisbee, basketball, and tennis. When I'm not outside, I like to play the piano and listen to music. You can view me in action by clicking on the images below:</p>
